My Project
•	My project basically consists of an application which combines a to-do list, calendar(classes/general) and a blog (writing about daily experiences)
•	I know for sure that I will use Tkinter library, the random library and the math library. I will then research further which libraries I can use to make my application cooler and more sophisticated.
•	The user interface will be divided into different sections. The left side will contain the different features that I want in this application, namely, the to-do list, the calendar and the blog. The remaining screen will contain the date and “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” according to the time of the day. There will also be background which will change over a period of time.
•	I will try my best to implement features like the to-do list by the first milestone. And if I get time, I will try to implement the other features and hopefully add other features.
